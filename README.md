# daily_weather_app

This app uses the API from https://open-meteo.com/ to gather weather data and print a daily weather report when run.

It is capable of printing more information, currently it will only print the weather data for the current day.

To use the app update the latitude and longitude to your needs in:

om_params = {
"latitude": DESIRED_LAT,
"longitude": DESIRED_LONG,
...
}

om_params = {
"latitude": DESIRED_LAT,
"longitude": DESIRED_LONG,
...
}
